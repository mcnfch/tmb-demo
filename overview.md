Got it ‚Äî thanks for clarifying. Let‚Äôs reframe and give you a **single comprehensive picture** that ties together **cloud, on-prem, EUC, labor, and HPC/scalable workloads** under one TBM demo framework, with a specific focus on **HPC variable scaling and load vs. cost**.

---

# üåê Comprehensive TBM Demonstration Blueprint (with HPC & Scaling)

---

## 1. **Vision**

The demo portal simulates what an **enterprise hybrid client** would expect from a TBM system: **end-to-end transparency across IT towers, services, and workloads**, including **HPC clusters** and **scalable cloud bursting**.

The framework lets leaders answer:

* Are my clusters over-provisioned (too much idle capacity)?
* Are my cloud bursts cost-effective (reserved vs spot vs on-demand)?
* What is the **cost per simulation / project / BU**, and how does it trend over time?

---

## 2. **Architecture / Stack (Demo-friendly, Near-Zero Cost)**

* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Neon free tier) or DuckDB (local).
* **Transforms:** dbt-core (normalize, allocate, scenario modeling).
* **Visualization:** Metabase (OSS dashboards) + optional Next.js exec UI.
* **Seed Data:**

  * **FOCUS Sandbox** for cloud.
  * **Mock GL + CMDB** for on-prem.
  * **Synthetic EUC & labor**.
  * **Synthetic HPC cluster + burst data** (CPU/GPU hours + cost).
* **Standards:**

  * **FOCUS schema** ‚Üí provider-neutral detail.
  * **TBM taxonomy v4** ‚Üí towers/services (Workplace, Compute, Storage, Network, HPC).

---

## 3. **Unified Data Model**

### Core Tables

* **Cloud:** `raw.focus_cloud_cost` (FOCUS-conformant line items).
* **On-Prem:** `raw.gl_onprem_cost`, `raw.cmdb_asset`, `raw.utilization_sample`.
* **EUC:** `raw.eu_device_inventory`, `raw.eu_cost_recurring`, `raw.eu_telemetry`.
* **Labor:** `raw.labor_cost` (Ops, SecOps, Platform, HPC team).
* **HPC:**

  * `raw.hpc_cluster_cost` ‚Üí monthly capex/opex/power/maintenance.
  * `raw.hpc_job_usage` ‚Üí jobs with CPU/GPU hours, BU/project tags.
  * `raw.hpc_cloud_burst` ‚Üí usage & spend for burst workloads (pricing\_model = spot/reserved/on\_demand).

### Reference

* `ref.allocation_map` ‚Üí tags/metadata to BU/App/Env.
* `ref.tbm_dimensions` ‚Üí TBM taxonomy.
* `ref.shared_cost_rules` ‚Üí spreading bases (spend, usage, FTE).

---

## 4. **Transformations / Allocation Logic**

1. **Cloud** ‚Üí normalize to FOCUS, allocate by tags + shared cost rules.
2. **On-Prem** ‚Üí amortize capex, spread infra costs by utilization.
3. **EUC** ‚Üí TCO per device (capex + recurring + soft costs from tickets/boot times).
4. **Labor** ‚Üí allocated by supported assets/projects.
5. **HPC:**

   * **Cluster TCO** = amortized capex + opex + power + cooling.
   * **Allocate cluster cost** by share of CPU/GPU hours.
   * **Blend cloud bursts**: merge `hpc_cloud_burst` with cluster jobs for true cost per project.
   * **Trend analysis**:

     * `avg_utilization = used_hours / (node_count * hours_in_month)`
     * Compare to spend ‚Üí reveals **over vs under resourcing**.

---

## 5. **Dashboards**

### Executive Dashboard

* Total IT Spend vs Budget/Forecast (trend)
* Spend by BU / Tower (Workplace, Cloud, HPC, etc.)
* Untagged % (hygiene)
* **HPC Cost vs Utilization trend**

### Finance Dashboard

* Budget vs Actual vs Forecast
* Chargeback/Showback by BU/App/Project
* GL ‚Üí TBM tower/service rollup

### Portfolio Dashboard

* Applications inventory (with lifecycle & cost)
* EUC refresh compliance & soft cost exposure
* Redundant SaaS / tools
* **HPC Project Cost Breakdown:**

  * Cost per project (on-prem vs burst)
  * Cost per CPU/GPU hour
  * Allocation across BUs

### HPC / Scaling Dashboard

* **Cluster Utilization vs Capacity vs Cost (MoM trend)**
* **Cloud Burst Spend by Pricing Model** (on-demand vs reserved vs spot)
* **Over/Under Resourcing Indicator:**

  * Idle cluster % > 40% = over-provisioned
  * Cloud bursts while idle exists = misallocation
* **ROI Scenarios:**

  * Add 20% cluster capacity vs rely on spot ‚Üí which is cheaper?
  * Shift 30% jobs to reserved instances ‚Üí cost savings vs risk.

---

## 6. **ROI & Scenario Modeling**

* **Scenario Params:** refresh years (EUC), warranty tier, license consolidation %, VDI ratio, HPC cluster size, % of jobs burst to cloud, reserved/spot mix.
* **Outputs:**

  * TCO delta (3-yr horizon)
  * ROI % and payback period
  * Savings waterfall (Capex ‚Üë vs Variable ‚Üì vs Soft ‚Üì)

---

## 7. **Development Roadmap (4 Weeks)**

**Week 1 ‚Äì Foundations**

* Load mock cloud, on-prem, HPC, EUC, labor data into Postgres.
* dbt project + staging models.

**Week 2 ‚Äì Core TBM Marts**

* Build allocation models (cloud + on-prem + HPC).
* Amortization + utilization calcs.

**Week 3 ‚Äì Dashboards**

* Metabase dashboards: Exec, Finance, Portfolio, HPC.
* Role-based filters (CIO, CFO, BU head).

**Week 4 ‚Äì ROI & Scenarios**

* Add HPC scaling what-ifs (cluster size vs burst).
* Add EUC refresh/warranty ROI.
* Polish dashboards + screenshots.

---

## 8. **Key Takeaways**

* This demo **mirrors what large TBM clients expect**: cloud, on-prem, EUC, labor, **HPC with scaling trends**.
* **HPC load vs cost analysis** is central: show leaders whether clusters are overbuilt or whether cloud bursts are justified.
* All built on **demo data in Postgres**, using open standards (FOCUS + TBM taxonomy), and presented in a **lightweight OSS stack**.
* Quick wins (variance, hygiene, top drivers, ROI scenarios) ensure value is obvious even in a demo.

üëâ This is the **comprehensive picture**: every IT cost domain (cloud, on-prem, EUC, labor, HPC) unified, with dashboards that expose **cost vs utilization trends** to highlight over/under resourcing.

Would you like me to **generate a one-page architecture diagram** (boxes: Data Sources ‚Üí DBT ‚Üí Postgres ‚Üí Dashboards) with an HPC ‚Äúcapacity vs cost‚Äù lens highlighted, so you can *show* this visually in your prep?
